# Interlude: Living World - an offline/solo Lineage 2 server

A fork of **L2J Mobius CT_0 Interlude** turned into a single-player **"Living World"**:
you log in and the server *feels* populated - towns full of NPCs, working private
shops, trade chat, field hunters, and recruitable combat parties - without any other
humans online. Play the classic Interlude chronicle solo, at your own pace, on your own
machine.

## What makes it a "Living World"

- **Populated towns** - data-driven NPC "fake players" wander the cities with procedural
  identities and run **functional private shops** you can actually buy from.
- **Field hunters** - clientless phantom characters auto-hunt the field zones, so the
  world outside town isn't empty either.
- **Recruitable parties** - shout *Looking for Members / Looking for Party* and a
  level-matched party spawns, walks over, and joins you.
- **Personal support buddy** - party a phantom as your own dedicated buffer/healer.
- **Living chat (optional)** - an optional LLM "brain" lets bots hold in-character
  whisper / say / trade / shout conversations. Fully optional; the server runs without it.

Everything else is stock **Interlude (Chronicle 6 / CT_0)** gameplay from the L2J Mobius
core - augmentation, Seven Signs, sieges, raids, the full quest and skill set.

## Quick start (Windows, install nothing)

The easiest way to play. You do **not** need Java, a database, or any setup.

1. Download the latest **`L2J-Offline-OneClick.zip`** from the
   [**Releases**](../../releases) page.
2. Unzip it anywhere.
3. Double-click **`Start-Server.bat`**.

On first run it initializes a bundled, portable MariaDB, imports the schema, then starts
the login and game servers - a bundled JDK and database are inside the zip, so there's
nothing to install. Later runs start straight up. `Stop-Server.bat` shuts everything down
cleanly.

Then connect your **Interlude game client** to the server (see
[Connecting the client](#connecting-the-client) below) and log in:

- Accounts are **auto-created on first login** - just type any username and password.
- Log in with the username **`admin`** (any password) to get a **GM account**: every
  character on the `admin` account is automatically granted master access on entering the
  world, so admin commands (`//admin`, etc.) work out of the box - no database editing.
- **Any other username** creates a **normal player account** with no admin rights.

> The pack is large (~0.5 GB) because a full JDK and a database engine are bundled
> inside it. That is the price of "installs nothing."

### Connecting the client

You need a **Lineage 2 Interlude** client (the server does not ship one).

- **Easiest - pre-configured L2.exe:** find and download an interlude client and then
  download the ready-to-play l2.exe from **[here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4rom0v9yuc7za4y/L2.exe/file)**. It's already
  set to connect to `127.0.0.1`, so just run it and log in.
  WARNING - For some shared clients, users sometimes rename "L2.bin" to "L2.exe" (which is the same file).
  In such cases, rename the existing "L2.exe" back to "L2.bin" and replace it with the "L2.exe" from the link provided above.
- **Manual - your own Interlude client:** point it at the local server by editing the
  client's `system/l2.ini` so the login server host is `127.0.0.1` (or add a `hosts`
  entry mapping the login server's hostname to `127.0.0.1`). Then launch and log in.

> The Lineage 2 client is NCSOFT's property; distribute or download it at your own
> discretion, the same as any fan project.

## Optional: the LLM chat brain

The bots work fully without this. If you want them to hold natural, in-character
conversations, run the small Python "brain" alongside the server. It's a local Flask
service the game server calls over HTTP.

It needs a model to think with - a **local model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)** (no
API key, runs on your machine) or a hosted API. **Python is installed automatically** if
you don't already have it.

**If you're using the one-click pack:** the brain is bundled at `dist\brain\`. Just
double-click `dist\brain\setup_brain.bat` - it installs Python if needed, asks Ollama vs
DeepSeek, and sets everything up. To have the launcher start it automatically, set
`StartBrain=true` in `dist\launcher\launcher.ini`. See `dist/brain/README.md` in the pack
for details.

**If you cloned the source repo:** on Linux/macOS the one-step script does everything:

```bash
cd "L2J_Mobius_CT_0_Interlude github"
./setup_brain.sh          # installs Ollama, pulls a model, sets up a venv, launches
```

On Windows use `setup_brain.bat`. To run it manually:

```bash
cd "L2J_Mobius_CT_0_Interlude github"
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # (Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python fpc_brain.py       # serves http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Configure it with a `.env` file in that folder:

```ini
# Local model (recommended, no key needed):
PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1

# — or — a hosted provider:
# PROVIDER=deepseek
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Then set `StartBrain=true` in `dist/launcher/launcher.ini` (or start it yourself) so the
server talks to it.

## Building from source (maintainers / developers)

You only need this if you want to change the Java server or rebuild the one-click pack.

**Requirements:** a full **JDK 25** (not a JRE - the server compiles datapack scripts at
runtime and needs `javac`) and **Apache Ant**.

Build the server jars:

```bash
cd "L2J_Mobius_CT_0_Interlude github"
ant
```

### Producing the one-click pack

Two ways:

- **In the cloud (no local JDK/Ant needed):** run the **"Build one-click pack"** GitHub
  Action from the repository's **Actions** tab ("Run workflow"). When it finishes,
  download the `L2J-Offline-OneClick` artifact and publish it on the Releases page.
- **Locally on Windows:** from `L2J_Mobius_CT_0_Interlude github/dist/launcher/` run
  `build-pack.bat` (or `build-pack.ps1` with options). It builds the jars, bundles a full
  JDK 25 and a portable MariaDB, and produces `L2J-Offline-OneClick.zip`.

See `dist/launcher/README.md` for the full build-and-run details, launcher options, and
the external-database path (running against your own MySQL/XAMPP instead of the bundled
DB).

### Docker on Linux

The repository also includes a Docker Compose deployment for Linux. It runs MySQL, the
login server, and the game server as separate services. The `dist/game` and `dist/login`
trees are mounted from the checkout, so runtime data writes can persist and most
datapack/configuration edits need only a container restart; Java source changes rebuild
the image.

See [the Docker deployment guide](docs/docker-deployment.md) for host networking,
firewall setup, and rebuild rules. Client setup is documented separately in the
[`l2.ini` patching guide](docs/l2-ini-patching.md) and the
[Linux Steam/Proton guide](docs/linux-client-steam-proton.md).

---

## Configuration

Server settings live in `L2J_Mobius_CT_0_Interlude github/dist/game/config/` (standard
L2J Mobius `.ini` files). The custom "Living World" systems are configured under
`config/Custom/` (e.g. `FakePlayers.ini`) and via the XML behaviour/route files under
`dist/game/data/`. Rates, spawns, and the fake-player populations are all adjustable
there.
